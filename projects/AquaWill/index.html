          <p>Aqua&#39;s Will is a student program at SHU. By creating a single-player game, our goal is to make
            people realize the importance of protecting the environment with a compelling backstory and detailed
            action.</p>
          <p>This was a 6 person team project where we created an ocean pollution-related game for the 2023
            Tencent Youth Game Design Challenge.</p>

            <h5 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Today, 40 percent of the world&#39;s oceans are severely impacted by humans, and more than half of
                the coastal habitats are being degraded. As humans enjoy the natural gifts of the ocean, we must not
                forget the pain that the ocean has experienced.
              The team took the lack of people&#39;s understanding of the state of marine pollution as the
                background of the research, and created a project on the theme of the ocean, with the aim of
                popularizing general knowledge of the ocean and protecting the marine environment.
            </p>
            <h5 id="our-goal">Our Goal</h5>
            <p>By creating a single-player game, our goal is to make people realize the importance of protecting
                the environment with a compelling backstory and detailed action.</p>
            <p>The game combines a touching story with an immersive art presentation to provide players with an
                exquisite gaming experience.</p>
            <h5 id="my-duty">My Duty</h5>
            <p>As the lead programmer and designer on the team, my responsibilities include crafting scene
                interactions and writing enemy AI to bring this game world to life.</p>
            <h5 id="introductory-scene"><strong>INTRODUCTORY SCENE</strong></h5>
            <p>The gameplay experience begins with an introductory scene that invites the player into Aqua&#39;s
                world with a story opening. Through on-screen transitions, the player becomes Aqua and embarks on a
                quest to save his friends.</p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/introScene.png" style="zoom:100%;" /></p>
            <p>Aqua, the sea spirit, is a messenger of the ocean. Sea Spirits and Whale Sharks are very good
                friends, they often play and swim together. At an unknown time, mankind began to endlessly dump
                pollutants into the ocean, and the whale sharks living in the caves mutated due to the erosion of
                pollutants, and kept hitting the walls of the caves in pain, and the sea was shaken by it.
              Hearing the whale shark&#39;s call, Aqua decides to go to the undersea cave to purify the
                whale shark and make it change back to its original form.
            </p>
            <h5 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h5>
            <h6 id="main-character">Main Character</h6>
            <p>Players take on the role of Aqua, a sea spirit, and use their skills to pass through various
                obstacles and travel to the deepest part of the ocean to purify the mutated whale sharks.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Aqua is the messenger of the ocean, so the level of pollution in the ocean is closely related
                    to Aqua, who has an oxygen bar and a pollution bar, which will produce different results through
                    different interactions with the surrounding environment:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the dark, oxygen-free dead zone the oxygen bar decreases, the oxygen bar decreases to
                      zero, and the game ends.</li>
                  <li>The Pollution Bar increases over time and increases dramatically when the Sea Spirit touches
                      an oil or trash drop, is touched by an enemy, or is attacked by an enemy. Aqua will reduce the
                      Pollution Bar by a certain amount by launching a ball of light at a mutated creature and
                      successfully purifying the creature. Once the pollution bar is full, the game ends.</li>
                  <li>If Aqua is hit by a falling rock, falls into a giant vortex, or is struck by a spiked
                      wolfsbane, the game is over!</li>
                </ul>

            <h6 id="game-scene-design-iteration">Game Scene Design Iteration</h6>
            <p>At first, our team designed the following map, then we gradually added all kinds of organs and
                traps in the map, and built TileMap for user testing, then, we encountered problems:</p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/mapIteration.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: In the initial map design, we created a vast and intricate
                world. However, during user testing, a player raised a critical issue - the immense open spaces made it
                difficult to find the path to the final boss. At the same time, players responded that they didn&#39;t
                know what the organs on the road were and how those organs worked on the players.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: We added visual cues, landmarks, and defined pathways to
                guide players while revising the grand scale of the environment. </p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/visualCues.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
            <p>Additionally, we restructured certain areas of the map, breaking down the larger open spaces into
                more manageable sections connected by well-defined pathways. This not only facilitated easier navigation
                but also enhanced the overall flow of gameplay.</p>
            <p>After this improvement, there was a noticeable increase in player ratings of the maps, which they
                felt were helpful in helping them understand the map&#39;s content and complete the flow of the game.
              </p>
            <p>Here&#39;s the iteration of final map:</p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/finalMap.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
            <h5 id="coding---enemy-system">Coding - ENEMY SYSTEM</h5>
            <h6 id="customized-enemy-ai-system">Customized Enemy AI System</h6>
            <p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>
            <p>When creating a platform-adventure game, one of the primary concerns is designing the enemy AI
                system.</p>
            <p>Initially, we employed a commercially available AI middleware for our game&#39;s enemy characters,
                which offered basic functionalities for patrolling, detecting the player, and engaging in combat.
                However, we encountered a significant challenge in achieving the desired level of complexity and
                intelligence in enemy behavior. Additionally, as our game heavily relies on the AI to provide dynamic
                and immersive gameplay experiences, we found it necessary to explore the development of a custom AI
                system to meet our specific requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p>
            <p>To overcome these challenges, I studied the main ways to compose an enemy AI.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conditional judgment</li>
              <li>Finite state machines</li>
              <li>Behaviour Tree</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, our group chose to customize the state machine to complete the writing of the enemy
                (specifically the Boss) AI. By calculating the state and position of the boss and the position of the
                player, the boss can &quot;intelligently&quot; track the player and make it more difficult for the
                player to hit the boss. In addition, our AI takes into account the collision system, so that when the
                player tries to get close to the boss, the boss will unleash the collision skill, so that the player
                will have to stay at a certain distance to fight the boss.
              I was responsible for the development of the entire state machine. After implementing the system and
                conducting several tests, we achieved remarkable results. The illustration shows the state description
                of the Boss.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/bossStatus.png" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
            <p>For the Boss requirements are as follows: </p>
            <ol start="">
              <li>The enemy can automatically follow the protagonist; </li>
              <li>The enemy model has a total of four actions: Idle (Idle) Run (Run) Attack (Attack) Death (Death)
                  Impact (Smash); </li>
              <li>Requirements of the enemy at the right time to make the right action. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>First of all, we added PolygonCollider2D collider to the art material, which supports manual dragging
                and dropping of shapes, but it will be very troublesome if there is a need to change the collider in the
                game later. The state machine is then subdivided into a state machine system, a state base class, an
                actual script that is mounted on the object, which utilizes inheritance from the state base class to
                write different states, a state machine system that controls the state method calls and additions and
                deletions, and then the actual script on the object that registers the events to add each state in. Then
                use the animation frame production, in the use of animation frame events there are a few points to note:
              </p>
            <ol start="">
              <li>Three parameters can only pass one of the three, or no parameters. </li>
              <li>Function event function source must have an Animator component. </li>
              <li>Object if empty, then it will default to choose its own bound script as the event function
                  provided. After we finish binding the animation frame events, we can just play the animation to
                  automatically generate the fireballs. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>So in the Boss skill, just play the animation, as well as follow the conditions and flow in the
                flowchart to switch the state to complete the creation of the Boss AI.</p>
