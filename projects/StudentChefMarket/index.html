                    <p><strong>We need to care about them.</strong></p>
                    <p>In Canada, the major problem of concurrent food insecurity and waste is a growing
                        socio-economic
                        issue that has significantly intensified over the last two decades.</p>
                    <p>We started from that point, and revised our problem to narrow food insecurity further
                        through
                        qualitative research. Due to our survey, many student said they had to skip meals despite
                        not
                        wanting to, which may also imply a lack of accessibility and/or time. This is a sign that
                        existing
                        solutions to this problem aren’t adequate enough to address the needs of the majority of
                        those
                        affected. Thus, instead of focusing on food insecurity as a whole, we are focusing on food
                        accessibility. This focus includes food accessibility regarding pricing, dietary
                        accommodations,
                        etc. </p>
                    <h3 id='my-roles'>My Roles</h3>
                    <p>I conducted full-process user-research methodologies (i.e. usability testing, speed-dating
                        protocols, interview protocol creation, competitor analysis processes, affinity diagramming,
                        etc.).
                        I also used design strategies such as prototyping in Figma, rapid sketching exercises,
                        feedback and
                        critiquing techniques, and others.</p>
                    <h2 id='executive-summary'>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <h3 id='goal'>Goal</h3>
                    <p>Ameliorate food accessibility issue starting from empowering students in University of
                        Toronto
                        through more access to healthy, clean foods.</p>
                    <h3 id='solution-1'>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We decided to build a student chef market place to ameliorate the food accessibility issue
                        in
                        University of Toronto. The design is for an all-in-one marketplace for students looking to
                        buy
                        premade meals by other students and sell ready-made meals to other students.</p>

                    <h3 id='the-users'>The Users</h3>
                    <p><strong>Target Users:</strong> Students at University of Toronto.</p>
                    <h4 id='user-interviews'>User Interviews</h4>
                    <p>Our team adopts two options for Formative study, which are questionnaires and
                        interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our first round of interviews, I conducted 2 interviews with students to get a better
                        understanding of their feelings towards and experiences with negotiating. I co-wrote our
                        interview
                        script, which encouraged storytelling and guided conversation with participants.</p>
                    <p>Hamza&#39;s Experience</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Finding Suitable Food on Campus</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Hamza, who follows Islamic dietary rules, struggles to find diverse and enjoyable
                                    halal food on campus. Limited and repetitive choices, along with concerns about
                                    freshness due to large-scale preparation, highlight the need for more inclusive food
                                    options that cater to the varied cultural and dietary needs of all students.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Balancing Cost and Quality</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Although Hamza can afford to spend $35 daily on food, he often feels guilty when the
                                    meals are unsatisfying and go to waste. Balancing cost, convenience, and quality is
                                    a common struggle for many students, highlighting the need for more affordable,
                                    high-quality food options on campus.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Skipping Meals and Avoiding Food Banks</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hamza often skips meals or chooses less healthy options on campus due to the limited
                                    food choices. He's uncomfortable using food banks, fearing the quality and facing
                                    added complexity as an international student. This highlights the importance of
                                    ensuring food support services are high-quality, welcoming, and accessible to all
                                    students, regardless of their background.</li>

                    <p>Arushi&#39;s Experience</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Graduate Student Life and Food Choices</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Arushi, a graduate student, navigates the challenges of balancing academic demands,
                                    personal life, and ensuring access to nutritious food. Past experiences with campus
                                    food shape her perspective on food security, highlighting the complexities of
                                    graduate student life, including financial constraints and time limitations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Arushi&#39;s past experiences navigating challenges in accessing affordable and
                                    nutritious food inform her current strategies, such as budgeting and meal planning,
                                    to address food insecurity. These insights could guide the development of supportive
                                    interventions for graduate students, ensuring they have access to the necessary food
                                    for academic and personal well-being.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Arushi utilizes digital platforms to streamline her food management, aligning with
                                    budget, time, and dietary preferences. Engaging with apps for affordable options and
                                    waste reduction, she highlights the role of technology in improving food access for
                                    graduate students, ensuring a balanced and nutritious diet amidst busy schedules.

                        <li>The majority of subjects did not use the food bank, and those who did use the food
                            bank went
                            there only occasionally.</li>
                        <li>Some students do not have access to satisfactory food due to limitations in dietary

                            food options on or around campus that cater to their nutritional requirements, ensuring
                            their
                            physical well-being and enabling them to focus on their studies without the constant
                            worry of
                            food insecurity.</li>
                        <li>Students with limited financial resources require convenient and cost-effective food
                            options

                    <p>To start the design stage, I usedspeed dating method and gathered participants’ reactions
                        to each
                        storyboard scenario. I discovered which speed dating concepts were universally accepted and
                        which
                        ones were not so popular.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Accommodate Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Motivation &amp; Purpose: Everyone deserves access to food that aligns with
                                    their
                                    personal, cultural, or religious beliefs. Whether it&#39;s vegetarian, vegan,
                                    halal,
                                    kosher, or any other dietary restriction, it&#39;s essential that individuals
                                    don&#39;t
                                    feel excluded or marginalized because of their dietary choices. Our design aims
                                    to
                                    ensure inclusivity, recognizing and respecting the diverse dietary needs of the
                                    community, and ensuring that everyone has access to food that aligns with their
                                    preferences and beliefs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Motivation &amp; Purpose: While access to food is crucial, it&#39;s equally
                                    important
                                    that the food is nutritious. Many facing food insecurity resort to cheaper, less
                                    nutritious options, which can have long-term health implications. Our design
                                    emphasizes
                                    the importance of nutritional adequacy, ensuring that individuals not only have
                                    access
                                    to food but that the food is balanced, wholesome, and supports their overall
                                    well-being.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Prioritize Freshness and Taste</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Motivation &amp; Purpose: Quality matters. No one should have to compromise on
                                    the
                                    freshness or taste of their food, regardless of their financial situation.
                                    Whether
                                    accessing food from a store or a food bank, individuals should feel satisfied
                                    and enjoy
                                    their meal. Our design aims to ensure that food quality is maintained, offering
                                    fresh
                                    and tasty options that enhance the overall food experience.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Promote Affordability</strong></p>

                                <li>Motivation &amp; Purpose: Cost is a significant barrier for many facing the
                                    problem of
                                    food insecurity. High prices or small portions can alienate individuals, making
                                    them
                                    feel disconnected from food sources. Our design focuses on affordability,
                                    ensuring that
                                    everyone, regardless of their financial situation, can access sufficient,
                                    quality food
                                    without breaking the bank.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Maximize Accessibility</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Motivation &amp; Purpose: Access to food shouldn&#39;t be limited by physical
                                    location, mobility challenges, or any other barriers. Whether it&#39;s ensuring
                                    physical
                                    accessibility to food outlets for those with disabilities or leveraging
                                    technology to
                                    make food access more convenient for everyone, our design prioritizes universal
                                    accessibility. Everyone, regardless of their circumstances, should find it easy
                                    and
                                    convenient to access the food they need.In essence, these design requirements
                                    serve as
                                    the guiding principles for our solution, ensuring it is inclusive, nutritious,
                                    affordable, and accessible. By addressing these core areas, we aim to create a
                                    comprehensive solution that effectively tackles the multifaceted challenges of
                                    food

                    <p>We returned to our users for feedback. To test the efficacy and intuitiveness of our mobile
                            toolkit, we relied on users’ Think-Alouds to understand how our design concepts were
                            received.</p>
                    <p><strong>Think-Alouds</strong> are usability sessions where users are given a
                            few tasks
                            to complete, and are asked to think aloud, as a means to navigate an interactive prototype.
                            From
                            this, we were able to gather insights on the usability of the negotiation toolkit.

                    <p>Originally, I thought users might be monitoring the screen at all times to note their
                            progress, so
                            I zoomed in on the numeric information along with the progress information.</p>
                    <p>Also, after in-depth user research, I found that some users want to be able to stop as they
                            go, so
                            I added a separate play button for each workout.</p>

                            design
                            decisions. At the same time I was able to put my basic knowledge of UIUX design into
                            practice, using
                            common design decision tools such as affinity maps.</p>

                    <p>I conducted several user interviews during the project, and I learnt how to be a good

                            allowing users to express their feelings as much as possible during the interviews and
                            suggesting
                            improvements they would like to see in the design</p>-->
